  professionalSummary: `
    I'm a developer since 2013, I love to build beautiful
    UI's and apps that cause a positive impact in the world,
    It drives me, I began working as a fullstack developer
    working with tech such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP,
    Laravel and Joomla. Currently, I've been giving special
    attention to frontend development, I developed a profound
    interest in building good looking and improved user
    experience UI's. I am curious to know about how things work, 
    I am challenged by issues that are presented to me, in both 
    life and technology, although focusing on the front end, I am 
    also interested in backend technologies. I am self-taught, and 
    I am always updating my knowledge to deliver the best possible 
    user experience.
